# Development and Optimization of a GNN Enhanced Molecular Dynamics Simulation Framework

This repository contains code and resources for developing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) enhanced Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation framework using PyTorch and OpenMM. The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning models into MD simulations to predict interatomic forces and potential energies more accurately and efficiently.
