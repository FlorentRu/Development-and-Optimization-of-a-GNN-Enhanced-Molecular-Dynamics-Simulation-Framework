# Development and Optimization of a GNN Enhanced Molecular Dynamics Simulation Framework

The goal is to develop a framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks to predict interatomic forces in molecular systems, thereby accelerating Molecular Dynamics simulations without compromising accuracy. This repository contains code and resources for developing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) enhanced Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation framework using PyTorch and OpenMM. In this project we will integrate machine learning models into MD simulations to predict interatomic forces and potential energies more accurately and efficiently.

# Introduction

Traditional molecular dynamics simulations rely on predefined force fields, which may not capture all the quantum mechanical effects necessary for accurate modeling of complex molecular systems. By leveraging GNNs, we aim to learn interatomic potentials directly from quantum mechanical data, enabling simulations that are both accurate and computationally efficient.
